## üìã NEXT SESSION TASKS

### PRIORITY 1: Convert Docs 30 & 35 to HTML (Est. 15-20 min)

**Why these two first:**
- Doc 30 (Content Strategy): Most strategic - guides all content creation
- Doc 35 (Staff Training): Most customer-facing - used by retail staff daily

**Conversion Requirements:**
1. Use same HTML template as existing docs
2. Include proper navigation (back to Act 6, next/previous doc)
3. Maintain styling consistency (same CSS classes)
4. Ensure proper heading hierarchy for TOC
5. Test all internal anchor links

**Files to Create:**
- `docs/doc-30-content-strategy.html`
- `docs/doc-35-staff-training.html`

**Source Files (Already Corrected):**
- `docs/doc-30-content-strategy.md` (18K, ~750 lines, all corrections applied)
- `docs/doc-35-staff-training.md` (14K, ~700 lines, all corrections applied)

### PRIORITY 2: Convert Remaining Docs 31-34 to HTML (Optional)

**If time permits:**
- doc-31-brand-designer-brief.html
- doc-32-packaging-requirements.html
- doc-33-retail-experience.html
- doc-34-digital-strategy.html

**Less urgent because:**
- These are internal reference docs (not customer-facing)
- Markdown versions are sufficient for now
- Can be converted later as needed

### PRIORITY 3: Update Act 6 Navigation

**Update `docs/act-6-operating-plan.html`:**
- Ensure links to doc-30.html and doc-35.html work
- Update any broken links
- Test navigation flow

### PRIORITY 4: Final Deployment

**Commands:**
```bash
git add docs/doc-30-content-strategy.html docs/doc-35-staff-training.html
git commit -m "feat: convert docs 30 & 35 to HTML with corrected claims"
git push origin main
```

## üìå IMPORTANT NOTES

### What's Verified and Safe to Use
1. ‚úÖ Cold chain operations (verified in multiple source docs)
2. ‚úÖ Vacuum frying 70% less oil (exact quote from Training Catalog)
3. ‚úÖ 18 corporate clients by name (Gifting Catalog + Investor Updates)
4. ‚úÖ 46% Amazon repeat rate (Investor Q1 FY26)
5. ‚úÖ +6% QoQ walk-in conversion (Investor Q1 FY26)
6. ‚úÖ All pricing (‚Çπ49-‚Çπ7,249) verified in catalogs
7. ‚úÖ Product descriptions and origins (from catalogs)

### What's Been Removed/Adjusted
1. ‚ùå Specific temperature specs (4-8¬∞C) - not in source
2. ‚ùå "50+" Fortune 500 count - only 18 verified
3. ‚ùå Quality ratings (8.5/10, 4.8/5) - not in source
4. ‚ùå Conversion/retention percentages (60%, 70%) - not in source
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è FSSC 22000 - adjusted to "in progress" (Stage 1 complete)

### Design Specs Are Intentional
- All color codes, typography, packaging specs = DESIGN FRAMEWORKS ‚úÖ
- All store dimensions, materials, lighting = DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS ‚úÖ
- All training content, digital strategy = STRATEGIC FRAMEWORKS ‚úÖ
- These are NOT hallucinations - they're intentional strategic direction
