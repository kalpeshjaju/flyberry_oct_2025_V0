## VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY (CORRECTED)

### ‚úÖ TRUST THESE SOURCES (Flyberry Input Data)
**No verification needed - this is real business data:**

1. **GIFTING-CATALOG-EXTRACTED.md** - Actual corporate clients, product catalog
2. **RETAIL-CATALOG-EXTRACTED.md** - Actual products, pricing, SKUs
3. **INVESTOR-UPDATE-Q1-FY26** - Actual financial performance, metrics
4. **INVESTOR-UPDATE-Q4-FY25** - Actual financial performance
5. **TRAINING-CATALOG** - Actual product training materials
6. **PAST-BRAND-GUIDELINES** - Historical brand positioning

**Conclusion:** ‚úÖ ALL CLAIMS FROM THESE SOURCES ARE ACCURATE - Use as is

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFY THESE CLAIMS (External/Technical/Competitive)

**Need high-authority web sources or technical documentation:**

1. **"India's first cold chain for dates/nuts"** - Competitive claim, needs market research
2. **"Vacuum frying reduces oil by 70%"** - Technical spec, needs manufacturer/scientific source
3. **"FSSC 22000 certified"** - Certification claim, check if Flyberry has this certification
4. **"Cold chain 4-8¬∞C specification"** - Technical standard, verify industry norms
5. **"Top export grade"** - Industry term, verify grading standards exist

---

### üìä CALCULATE THESE METRICS (From Input Data)

**Should derive from actual source numbers:**

1. **"8.5/10 quality rating"** - Calculate from quality metrics if data exists
2. **"4.8/5 customer satisfaction"** - Should come from Google/Amazon reviews (external verification)
3. **"60% tasting conversion"** - Calculate from store metrics (transactions √∑ walk-ins)
4. **"70% corporate retention"** - Calculate from B2B client data (repeat clients √∑ total)

## SECTION 5: SUMMARY OF REQUIRED ACTIONS

### For Kalpesh to Confirm:

| Question | Why Important |
|----------|---------------|
| Do you have 50+ corporate clients total? | Adjust Fortune 500 claim if needed |
| Are Jordan/Iran/USA/Afghanistan/Ivory Coast actual suppliers? | Verify 7-country sourcing claim |
| Is cold chain currently operational at 4-8¬∞C? | Mark as current vs planned |
| Do you have FSSC 22000 certification? | Keep/remove/mark as "pursuing" |
| Where does 8.5/10 quality rating come from? | Verify or remove metric |
| Where does 4.8/5 satisfaction come from? | Check Google/Amazon or remove |
| Do you track tasting conversion (60%)? | Calculate from data or mark as target |
| Do you track corporate retention (70%)? | Calculate from data or mark as target |

### For Claude to Research:

| Claim | Research Needed |
|-------|-----------------|
| "India's first cold chain" | Check competitors (Nutraj, Happilo, Farmley) |
| "Vacuum frying 70% less oil" | Find manufacturer specs or scientific studies |
| "Top export grade" | Verify date industry grading standards |
| "4.8/5, 173 reviews" | Check Google Business / Amazon ratings |

### For Document Updates:

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- Adjust Fortune 500 claim if not 50+ (or confirm it is)
- Mark cold chain as current vs planned
- Verify/remove quality metrics (8.5/10, 4.8/5, 60%, 70%)
- Soften or cite technical claims (vacuum frying, certifications)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- Verify 7-country sourcing or adjust to verified countries
- Add data source citations for all verified claims
- Create "current vs planned" sections where needed

**LOW PRIORITY:**
- Convert Docs 30-35 to HTML (after data corrections)
- Implement ChromaDB chunking strategy
- Final deployment

## SECTION 6: CORRECTED APPROACH SUMMARY

### What I Was WRONG About:
‚ùå Saying "50+ Fortune 500" needs verification from source docs
- **Correct:** If Kalpesh says 50+, trust it (not all clients may be in catalog)

‚ùå Questioning if pricing tiers are accurate
- **Correct:** Source docs show pricing, trust it ‚úÖ

‚ùå Questioning if product descriptions are accurate
- **Correct:** Source docs show products, trust it ‚úÖ

### What I Was RIGHT About:
‚úÖ "India's first cold chain" needs competitor research
‚úÖ "Vacuum frying 70%" needs technical verification
‚úÖ "FSSC 22000" needs certification confirmation
‚úÖ Quality metrics (8.5/10, 4.8/5) need source identification
‚úÖ Conversion rates need calculation from actual data

## NEXT STEPS

**Option 1: I Research External Claims**
- Search competitor cold chain claims
- Find vacuum frying technical specs
- Check Google/Amazon ratings for Flyberry
- Find date grading standards

**Option 2: Kalpesh Confirms Internal Data**
- Answer 8 questions above about metrics and operations
- I then update documents accordingly

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
- I do external research (competitors, technical specs) now
- You confirm internal metrics (client count, cold chain status, ratings source)
- I update all documents with verified + confirmed data
- Convert to HTML and deploy

**Which approach would you like me to take?**
