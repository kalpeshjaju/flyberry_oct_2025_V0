## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines Flyberry's content strategy to operationalize the brand pillar hierarchy (Quality 50%, Innovation 25%, Fortune 500 10%, Transparency 15%) across all content touchpoints.

**Strategic Mandate:**
Every piece of content must serve one of four brand pillars. Content distribution must maintain 50/25/10/15 hierarchy across all platforms and phases.

**Content Mission:**
Build "Flyberry = exceptional quality" perception through evidence-based storytelling that showcases quality (hero), innovation (enabler), validation (proof), and transparency (trust).

**Platform Strategy:**
- **Quality Storytelling:** Instagram, YouTube (visual proof of excellence)
- **Innovation Showcasing:** Instagram Reels, YouTube (process transparency)
- **B2B Validation:** LinkedIn (corporate authority)
- **Transparency Education:** All platforms (trust building)

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY FRAMEWORK

### Core Principle: Pillar-First Content

**Every content piece must answer:**
1. **Which pillar does this serve?** (Quality/Innovation/Validation/Transparency)
2. **What evidence does it provide?** (Proof, not claims)
3. **Does it maintain hierarchy?** (Quality gets 50%, Innovation 25%, etc.)

**Non-Negotiable Rules:**

**Rule 1: Quality Always Leads**
- 50% of all content must focus on quality/taste/origins
- Quality content gets premium placement (feed, hero sections)
- Never compromise quality storytelling for novelty

**Rule 2: Innovation Serves Quality**
- Innovation content must answer: "How does this improve taste/freshness?"
- Cold chain = quality protection, not tech showcase
- Vacuum frying = taste preservation, not health claim

**Rule 3: Fortune 500 is Proof, Not Hero**
- Use as validation, not positioning ("Google validates our quality")
- B2C: Quality confirmation, not status symbol
- B2B: Trust shortcut for procurement decisions

**Rule 4: Transparency is Constant**
- Every product mention includes verification method
- QR codes, lab reports, origin badges are celebrated, not hidden
- Claims registry accessible in all marketing materials

- ❌ "Buy what Google buys" (status signaling)

**4. Constant Transparency**
- ✅ "Scan QR code to verify your batch quality"
- ❌ Hidden quality verification (transparency should be celebrated)
