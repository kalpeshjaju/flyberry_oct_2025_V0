## 1. BRAND NARRATIVE SCRIPT (3-Minute)

*Every team member must know this by heart*

> "Let me tell you the Flyberry story.
>
> For over 10 years, we've been curating the world's finest gourmet foods from 7 exclusive origins - Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, USA, Australia, Bolivia, and Turkey. We source Ajwa dates from the sacred Medina Valley, pine nuts from Afghanistan's Hindukush Mountains, and Brazil nuts directly from the Amazon rainforest.
>
> What makes us truly different? Three things:
>
> **First**, we're the ONLY brand in India with industry-first cold chain operations for dates. From the moment dates are harvested until they reach you, they're temperature-controlled. This preserves natural moisture, freshness, and taste - something no competitor can match.
>
> **Second**, we're trusted by 50+ Fortune 500 companies - Google, Goldman Sachs, Tata Steel, McKinsey, Coca-Cola - for their corporate gifting. When these companies choose Flyberry to represent their brand, that tells you everything about our quality.
>
> **Third**, we're a complete gourmet destination. 44 products across 8 categories - from Medjool dates to vacuum-fried chips with 70% less oil, from superfood seeds to sugar-free Date Syrup. One brand, complete gourmet needs.
>
> So when you choose Flyberry, you're not just buying dates or nuts. You're choosing Fortune 500-level quality, delivered fresh via cold chain, from the world's best origins. You're choosing what Google and Goldman Sachs choose."

## 3. OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

### Objection 1: "Why is Flyberry more expensive than Happilo?"

**Response**:
> "Great question! Three reasons: First, we're the ONLY brand with cold chain operations - that's temperature-controlled storage and delivery from source to you. Happilo doesn't have this. Second, we're trusted by 50+ Fortune 500 companies - Google, Goldman Sachs, Tata Steel choose us for their corporate gifting. That's validation Happilo doesn't have. Third, our sourcing - Ajwa dates from Medina, pine nuts from Hindukush, Brazil nuts from Amazon. You're not paying more - you're getting Fortune 500-level quality."

---

### Objection 2: "I've never heard of Flyberry"

**Response**:
> "That's actually our story! For 10 years, we've been the 'secret' behind Fortune 500 corporate gifting - Google, Goldman Sachs, Tata Steel all choose us. We've built our reputation serving India's best companies. Now we're making that same quality accessible to everyone. You're discovering what Fortune 500 companies have known for years."

### Objection 3: "What makes Flyberry different from other brands?"

**Response**:
> "Three things NO competitor has: One - Industry-first cold chain operations (we're the only brand in India doing this for dates). Two - Trusted by 50+ Fortune 500 companies for corporate gifting. Three - Complete gourmet portfolio: 44 products across 8 categories from 7 countries. Name another brand with all three. There isn't one. That's Flyberry."

---

### Objection 4: "Do you have [specific product]?"

**Response**:
> "Yes! We're a complete gourmet destination - 44 products across 8 categories. Dates (8 varieties), exotic nuts (6 types), vacuum-fried chips, superfood seeds, berries, dried fruits, and date innovations like Date Syrup and Date Powder. If it's gourmet, we have it. One brand, complete needs."

## 8. COLD CHAIN EXPLAINER (1-Pager)

### Title: "Why Cold Chain Matters for Dates"

**The Problem**:
Dates are perishable. Room temperature storage causes:
- Moisture loss (dates become hard, dry)
- Sugar crystallization (white coating)
- Flavor degradation
- Reduced shelf life

**The Flyberry Solution**:
Industry-FIRST cold chain operations:
1. **Source**: Dates harvested at peak ripeness
2. **Storage**: Temperature-controlled (2-8°C) from day 1
3. **Transport**: Refrigerated containers to India
4. **Warehouse**: Cold storage facility (FSSC 22000 certified)
5. **Delivery**: Temperature-controlled last-mile (quick commerce)

**The Result**:
- Dates stay soft, moist, fresh
- Natural flavor preserved
- Longer shelf life
- Taste the difference

**The Proof**:
- Taste test: Flyberry vs room temperature dates
- Customer feedback: 4.8/5 rating
- Fortune 500 trust: Google, Goldman Sachs choose us
