## COMMON CUSTOMER QUESTIONS

### About Dates

**Q: "Are dates good for diabetics?"**
A: Most dates have a low to medium glycemic index. Our Ajwa dates are particularly mild in sweetness. However, always recommend consulting with their doctor about portion sizes and monitoring blood sugar response.

**Q: "Which date is best for baking?"**
A: Deglet Nour is our baker's choice - firm texture holds up well, and the mild sweetness doesn't overpower other ingredients. Mini Medjoul also works beautifully when you want more concentrated sweetness.

**Q: "Do dates need refrigeration?"**
A: Premium dates like Medjoul benefit from refrigeration to maintain freshness. Our MAP-packaged dates (Deri MAP Box, Seedless Omani MAP Box) don't require refrigeration until opened. Other semi-dry dates can be stored in a cool pantry.

**Q: "Why are some dates so expensive?"**
A: Price reflects rarity, harvesting difficulty, and origin. Ajwa comes exclusively from Medina. Medjoul dates are hand-selected for size. Pine nuts require manual climbing of 100-foot trees. Quality and sourcing story justify premium pricing.

**Q: "How long do dates last?"**
A: Properly stored (refrigerated in airtight container):
- Medjoul dates: 6-12 months
- Semi-dry dates: 6-18 months
- MAP-packaged dates: Check package (typically 12-18 months)

### About Nuts

**Q: "Raw or roasted - which is healthier?"**
A: Raw nuts retain maximum nutrients. Roasting can reduce some vitamins but makes nuts more digestible and brings out flavor. We recommend raw for maximum nutrition, roasted for maximum enjoyment!

**Q: "How many Brazil nuts can I eat per day?"**
A: **ONLY 2 PER DAY**. Brazil nuts are the richest source of selenium. Too much selenium can be harmful. 2 nuts provide your daily requirement.

**Q: "Why are macadamia nuts so expensive?"**
A: Macadamias are one of the hardest nuts to grow and harvest. Trees take 7-10 years to bear fruit. Shells are extremely hard to crack. Limited growing regions. This all contributes to premium pricing.

**Q: "Are your nuts roasted or raw?"**
A: Our nuts are raw and natural unless specified. This preserves nutrients and allows customers to roast at home to their preference.

### About Seeds

**Q: "How do I eat chia seeds?"**
A: Never eat chia seeds dry - they absorb moisture and can cause digestive discomfort. Always soak them first (10 minutes minimum) in water, milk, or plant milk. They form a gel that's easy to digest.

**Q: "Can kids eat seeds?"**
A: Yes, seeds are great for kids! They're nutrient-dense. Just ensure:
- Young children (under 4): Grind seeds to prevent choking
- Older children: Whole seeds are fine
- Always supervise young children

**Q: "What's the difference between sunflower seeds in-shell and shelled?"**
A: In-shell takes longer to eat (good for mindful snacking), but shells aren't edible. Shelled (like ours) are convenient for adding to recipes and eating quickly.

### About Chips

**Q: "Are vacuum-fried chips really healthier?"**
A: Yes! Vacuum frying uses 70% less oil than conventional frying. It preserves more nutrients because of lower temperatures. And we use rice-bran oil (heart-healthy) instead of palm oil.

**Q: "Why are they more expensive than regular chips?"**
A: We use 4-10x more real vegetables/fruits to make the same weight of chips. Vacuum frying is more expensive equipment. Premium oil (rice-bran vs palm). No artificial ingredients means higher costs.

**Q: "Are they suitable for weight loss?"**
A: They're a better choice than regular chips (70% less oil, higher nutrients, real vegetables). But they're still a snack food - portion control matters. A 20g pack is a reasonable snack portion.

### About Berries

**Q: "Do dried berries have added sugar?"**
A: Our dried berries have NO added sugar. The sweetness comes from the fruit's natural sugars, which concentrate during drying.

**Q: "Are dried berries as nutritious as fresh?"**
A: Many nutrients are preserved or even concentrated during drying (antioxidants, fiber, minerals). Some Vitamin C is lost, but overall they remain very nutritious. Plus, they're available year-round and don't spoil.

**Q: "How do I rehydrate dried berries?"**
A: Soak in warm water, juice, or tea for 10-20 minutes until plump. Use the soaking liquid in recipes - it contains nutrients and flavor!
