This isn't marketing speak. This is **how Flyberry operates**.

## OUR SOURCING MAP: 7 GLOBAL ORIGINS

### Where We Source From (And Why)

## THE FLYBERRY QUALITY STANDARD

### What "Best-in-Class" Means

**Not all products are created equal.**

For example:
- **Medjoul Dates**: Graded by size (Large, Jumbo, Majestic). Flyberry sources **only Majestic grade** (5× larger than common varieties).
- **Macadamia Nuts**: Graded by Style (wholes, halves, pieces). Flyberry sources **only Style 0 (premium wholes)**.
- **Ajwa Dates**: Sourced exclusively from **Medina** (not generic "Saudi dates").

### Our Non-Negotiables

**1. Origin Certification**
- Every batch traceable to source country
- No "generic" sourcing (e.g., "Middle East dates")
- Specific terroir matters (Ajwa from Medina, not Riyadh)

**2. Grade Selection**
- Always premium/top export grade
- Consistent size, color, texture
- No mixing of grades

**3. Quality Testing**
- QR codes for test reports on all packaging
- "Taste " and "Test " certified
- Lab verification for pesticides, contaminants

**4. Freshness Guarantee**
- **Industry-first cold chain logistics** (for dates)
- Maintains optimal temperature from import to customer
- No room-temperature storage (prevents staleness, sugar crystallization)

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS: THE COMMODITY TRAP

### The Market Reality

**Most brands source commodities**:
- "Dates from Middle East" (no specific origin)
- Generic nuts (mixed grades, inconsistent quality)
- Room-temperature storage (leads to staleness)
- Price-driven sourcing (cheapest supplier wins)

**Result**: Acceptable products, forgettable brands.

### The Flyberry Difference

**We source best-in-class**:
- **Specific origins**: "Ajwa Dates from Medina" vs "dates from Saudi Arabia"
- **Premium grades**: "Majestic Medjoul" vs "mixed-grade dates"
- **Cold chain**: Industry-first for dates (2023 launch with Swiggy Instamart)
- **Quality-driven**: Best supplier wins (not cheapest)

**Result**: Exceptional products, Fortune 500-trusted brand.

## THE PROOF: NUTRITIONAL SUPERIORITY

### Why Origin + Grade Matters

**Example 1: Kalmi Dates vs Common Dates**
- **Kalmi Dates**: Almost **double the potassium than bananas** (per 100g)
- **Common dates**: Standard potassium levels

**Example 2: Brazil Nuts (Bolivia Wild-Harvested)**
- **2 nuts = 247% RDA of Selenium** (thyroid health, antioxidant)
- **Commercial farmed Brazil nuts**: Lower selenium (soil quality differences)

**Example 3: Medjoul Dates (Majestic Grade)**
- **Size**: 5× larger than common varieties
- **Calories**: 90 Kcal per date (sustained energy)
- **Taste**: Rich caramel notes (not generic sweetness)

## WHY 7 COUNTRIES?

### The Complete Gourmet Destination Vision

**Single-origin brands are limited**:
- Can't offer breadth (e.g., nut-only brands)
- Can't offer best-in-class across categories

**Multi-origin sourcing enables**:
- **8 product categories** (dates, nuts, berries, chips, seeds, dried fruits, date innovations, gifts)
- **42+ SKUs** (deepest portfolio in India)
- **Best-in-class quality** across ALL categories (not just one specialty)

**Result**: Flyberry becomes your **one-stop gourmet destination** — not a single-category player.
