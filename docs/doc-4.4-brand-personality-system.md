- Use Case: "Perfect for gifting, baking, or savoring"

---

### Tagline Development

**Current**: "Flyberry - Indulgence Redefined"

**Proposed Options** (Ruler-Lover-Creator archetypes):

**Option 1 - Ruler Primary**:
- "Trusted by Fortune 500, Crafted for You"
- Strengths: Authority validation, personal connection
- Weaknesses: Corporate-forward, less sensory

**Option 2 - Lover Primary**:
- "The Art of Gourmet Dates"
- Strengths: Mirrors Bateel positioning, sensory excellence
- Weaknesses: Dates-only implication (limits portfolio)

**Option 3 - Creator Primary**:
- "Reimagining Food - From Seven Countries to Your Table"
- Strengths: Innovation narrative, global sourcing
- Weaknesses: Wordy, less memorable

**Option 4 - Balanced (Recommended)**:
- "Gourmet Wellness from Global Artisans"
- Strengths: Bridges gourmet (Lover) + wellness (Caregiver legacy) + global craft (Creator)
- Weaknesses: Broad category positioning

**Recommendation**: Use "The Art of Gourmet Dates" as primary tagline. Retain "Reimagining Food" as brand philosophy (website, corporate materials).
