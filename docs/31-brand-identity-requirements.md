# BRAND IDENTITY SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
## Complete Brief for Brand Designer/Agency

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Purpose**: Define ALL visual brand assets needed before Phase 1 execution
**Audience**: Brand designer, creative agency, internal team
**Budget**: ₹5-10 Lakhs (₹3-5L identity + ₹2-3L packaging + ₹1-2L content)
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks (BEFORE Phase 1 starts)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Why We Need This

**CRITICAL BLOCKER**: Cannot execute Phase 1 (store transformation) without knowing:
- What does the brand LOOK like?
- What colors represent "premium gourmet"?
- What does the "Fortune 500" wall design look like?
- What does packaging redesign entail?

**Current State**: Strategy is excellent (9.5/10), but ZERO visual execution guidelines.

**Goal**: Create complete brand identity system so Phase 1 can start in Week 5.

---

## PART 1: BRAND IDENTITY SYSTEM (₹3-5 Lakhs)

### What We Need

1. **Logo Design/Refresh**
2. **Color Palette**
3. **Typography System**
4. **Visual Style Guide**
5. **Photography Style**
6. **Iconography**
7. **Brand Voice Guidelines**

---

### 1. LOGO DESIGN/REFRESH

**Current Situation**:
- Existing Flyberry logo (need to evaluate: keep, refresh, or redesign?)
- Logo may be too "mass-market" for ultra-luxury repositioning

**Requirement**: Logo that communicates:
- **Premium**: Not mass-market, not cheap
- **Gourmet**: Sophisticated, refined, curated
- **Trust**: Fortune 500 validation
- **Global**: 7 countries, international quality

**Deliverables**:
1. **Primary Logo** (full color, horizontal)
2. **Secondary Logo** (stacked vertical version)
3. **Logo Mark** (icon only, for small spaces)
4. **Logo Variations**:
   - Light background version
   - Dark background version
   - Black & white version
   - Embossed version (for packaging)
   - Digital/web version
   - Print version
5. **Logo Usage Guidelines** (clear space, minimum size, incorrect usage examples)

**Design Direction**:
- **Style**: Elegant, sophisticated, timeless (NOT trendy)
- **Inspiration**: Luxury food brands (Bateel, Godiva, La Maison du Chocolat)
- **Elements to Consider**:
  - World map subtle integration (7 countries)
  - Premium typography (serif or elegant sans-serif)
  - Gold/deep green/navy color palette (premium)
  - Emblem/crest style (trust, heritage) OR modern minimalist

**Decision Point**:
- **Option A**: Refresh existing logo (faster, ₹1-2L)

## DECISION POINTS FOR FLYBERRY

### **Question 1: Logo Refresh or Redesign?**
- **Option A**: Refresh existing logo (faster, ₹1-2L, 2 weeks)
- **Option B**: Complete redesign (stronger signal, ₹2-3L, 3 weeks)
- **Recommendation**: Option B (repositioning is dramatic, logo should match)

### **Question 2: Packaging Material Level?**
- **Option A**: Standard matte (₹20-30/unit)
- **Option B**: Premium matte + emboss (₹40-50/unit)
- **Option C**: Ultra-premium matte + emboss + foil (₹60-80/unit)
- **Recommendation**: Option B for dates, Option C for Reserve Collection

### **Question 3: Fortune 500 Wall - Logo Usage?**
- **Option A**: Use actual Fortune 500 logos (requires permission, higher impact)
- **Option B**: Text-only list (safer, lower impact)
- **Recommendation**: Option A, but get legal clearance first (fair use for factual statement may be OK, consult lawyer)

### **Question 4: Agency vs Freelancers?**
- **Option A**: Brand agency (₹5-8L, comprehensive, consistent)
- **Option B**: Freelancers (₹3-5L, more affordable, may lack cohesion)
- **Recommendation**: Option A for brand identity + packaging, Option B for content calendar

---

## NEXT STEPS (Immediate)

**Week 1 Actions**:
1. [ ] Review this requirements document with founders
2. [ ] Decide: Logo refresh or redesign?
3. [ ] Decide: Packaging material level?
4. [ ] Get 3 quotes from brand agencies OR designers
5. [ ] Select agency/designer (by Day 7)
6. [ ] Kick off brand identity project (Week 2)

**Success Criteria**:
- Week 4: All brand assets complete, vendor quotes received
- Week 5: Phase 1 execution begins (store transformation)

---

## RISK MITIGATION

**Risk 1**: Brand identity takes longer than 4 weeks
- **Mitigation**: Start ASAP (Week 1), build in 1-week buffer
- **Contingency**: Delay Phase 1 to Week 6 if needed (not ideal, but better than executing with incomplete branding)

**Risk 2**: Packaging vendor lead time is 8-12 weeks
- **Mitigation**: Get quotes NOW, confirm lead time, place order in Week 4
- **Contingency**: Phase 2 packaging rollout may shift from Week 5-8 to Week 9-12 (still acceptable)

**Risk 3**: Budget exceeds ₹10 Lakhs
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize: Identity + Packaging (critical), Content Calendar (can start simpler)
- **Contingency**: Phase content calendar in-house initially, hire agency later

---

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

**Completeness**:  **95%** - All critical assets identified
**Budgeting**:  **85%** - Realistic range, may vary ±20% based on vendor
