## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### ‚ùå Accuracy Issues (MUST FIX)
1. **Fortune 500 claim unverified** - "50+ Fortune 500 companies" appears 47 times, no proof
2. **Cold chain claims unsubstantiated** - "Industry-first" needs verification dates
3. **70% less oil claim** - No lab data or third-party verification
4. **Revenue projections unfounded** - ‚Çπ35 Cr ‚Üí ‚Çπ100 Cr with NO financial model

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Logic Issues
1. **Positioning contradictions** - Says "mid-range pricing" but has ‚Çπ49-‚Çπ7,249 range
2. **Tier confusion** - Brand architecture proposes tiers but products don't map
3. **Identity crisis** - Calls self "snacks" but sells ‚Çπ7,249 luxury hampers

### üî¥ Depth Issues
1. **No financial modeling** - No P&L, ROI, break-even for ‚Çπ100 Cr projection
2. **Generic strategies** - Digital/content strategies could apply to any brand
3. **Missing execution** - Lists materials instead of creating actual materials

## NEXT STEPS (RECOMMENDED)

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Verify Fortune 500 claims** - Get permission or remove company names
2. **Build financial model** - 3-year P&L for revenue projections
3. **Substantiate cold chain** - Get partnership dates, verification
4. **Execute merger** - Actually consolidate docs 21+23+24+25 into new doc 21

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
5. **Rewrite superficial docs** - Content calendar, digital strategy, sales enablement
6. **Enhance financials** - Add ROI, break-even, sensitivity analysis
7. **Condense doc 20** - Remove 60% repetition (save 574 lines)

### LOW PRIORITY
8. **Add execution tools** - RACI matrix, critical path analysis
9. **Enhance metrics** - Baselines, dashboards, attribution model
10. **Update GitHub Pages** - Reflect new merged structure in navigation
