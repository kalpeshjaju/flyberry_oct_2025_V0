## THE PROBLEM

**We documented the merge but never executed it:**

1. ✅ **Documentation** - Created all markdown files explaining the merge
2. ✅ **Index.html** - Updated to show merged Act 4
3. ✅ **Navigation** - Updated all pages to 4 acts
4. ❌ **Actual HTML merge** - Never merged act-4 + act-6 HTML files
5. ❌ **Content creation** - Never created docs 31-39 HTML sections

**Result**:
- index.html promises 21 documents (19-39)
- act-4-where-we-should-go.html only has 12 documents (19-30)
- **9 documents missing** (31-39)

## WHY THIS HAPPENED

**We only did the planning, not the execution:**

1. ✅ **Audited** all 62 documents
2. ✅ **Documented** which docs to merge/delete
3. ✅ **Updated** index.html to show the new structure
4. ✅ **Deleted** act-6-operating-plan.html file
5. ❌ **Never merged** the actual HTML content
6. ❌ **Never created** docs 31-39 as HTML sections in Act 4

**It's like we created the architectural plans but never built the building.**

## RECOVERY OPTIONS

### Option 1: Recover act-6 file and keep both acts
- Restore act-6-operating-plan.html from git
- Update navigation to show 5 acts (1, 2, 3, 4, 6)
- Update index.html to show Act 4 (12 docs) + Act 6 (18 docs)
- **Pro**: Easiest, no HTML work needed
- **Con**: Goes back to original structure, audit findings ignored

### Option 2: Create merged act-4 HTML file (RECOMMENDED)
- Restore act-6-operating-plan.html from git temporarily
- Extract docs 31-39 content from act-6
- Add to act-4-where-we-should-go.html
- Create complete merged Act 4 with all 21 documents
- **Pro**: Executes the merge as documented
- **Con**: Requires HTML editing and content organization

### Option 3: Keep current Act 4, update index.html to match reality
- Keep act-4-where-we-should-go.html as is (12 docs)
- Update index.html to say Act 4 has 12 docs (19-30), not 21
- Remove references to docs 31-39
- **Pro**: Quick fix, matches reality
- **Con**: Loses all execution content, incomplete package

## RECOMMENDATION

**Option 2: Complete the merge**

**Why**:
- We did the audit and found 30% superficial content
- We documented which docs to merge/delete
- We promised a merged Act 4 in index.html
- **We should finish what we started**

**What needs to happen**:
1. Recover act-6-operating-plan.html from git (commit 998838a)
2. Extract relevant sections (docs 31-39 content)
3. Add to act-4-where-we-should-go.html in organized sections
4. Delete superficial content as documented
5. Create cohesive merged Act 4 with all 21 documents

**Time required**: 2-3 hours of HTML editing and content organization

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### What to do RIGHT NOW:

**DECISION NEEDED**: Which option do you prefer?

1. **Keep it simple** - Restore Act 6, go back to 5 acts (Option 1)
2. **Complete the merge** - Create merged Act 4 with all content (Option 2)
3. **Match reality** - Update index.html to say Act 4 only has 12 docs (Option 3)

**Once decided, I can execute immediately.**
