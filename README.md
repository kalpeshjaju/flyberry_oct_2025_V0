## Data Quality Standards

**No Hallucinations**: All claims verified from source documents
**No Data Invention**: All metrics traced to investor updates, catalogs, research
**No Unrealistic Creativity**: Recommendations based on luxury brand conventions (October 2025)

**Verified Data Sources**:
- Gifting Catalog (Fortune 500 clients, page 4)
- Retail Catalog (55+ SKUs, pricing ₹49-₹3,960)
- Training Catalog (sensory descriptions, health benefits)
- Investor Update Q1 FY26 (₹9.7 Cr revenue, 32% YoY, e-commerce +236%)
- Cultural Insights Research (October 2025 - Indian luxury food market)
- Luxury Brand Positioning Research (Bateel, Godiva, Fortnum & Mason)

**Limitations**:
- No primary brand perception research conducted
- No customer testing of proposed positioning
- Budget guidance directional only (not final line items)
- Recommendations based on best practices, not Flyberry-specific testing

**ACT 4** (Validation Gaps):
1. Brand concept testing (500 customers - will new positioning resonate?)
2. Message hierarchy testing (which messages convert best?)
3. Visual identity testing (premium perception achieved?)

**ACT 6** (Execution Gaps):
1. Detailed budget breakdown (line-item budgets for 24 months)
2. Vendor selection (packaging, design, marketing agencies)
